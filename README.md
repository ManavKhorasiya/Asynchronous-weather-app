# Asynchronous-weather-app
1. Weather app using node js. 

2. API used- locationIq(for latitude and longitude) and darksky(for temperature)

3. All files are inside playground folder

4. Original file app.js uses callbacks
 
5. Geocode.js uses locationIq API to fetch co-ordinates
 
6. Weather.js uses darksky to fetch temperature based on co-ordinates
 
7. Both geocode.js and weather.js are synced with each other in app.js
 
9 promise.js is file to understand working of promises in javascript

10. app-promise.js uses axios library to do the same tasks as app.js but by using promise instead of callbacks.
